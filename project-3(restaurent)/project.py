# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing
# Load your dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing steps

# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'data' with features and labels
# X should contain features, y should contain labels
X = data.drop('Outcome', axis=1)  # Assuming 'Outcome' is the column indicating match results
y = data['Outcome']

# Step 2: Data Splitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Model Training
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Model Evaluation
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Optional: Hyperparameter Tuning
# Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search

# Optional: Model Deployment
# If you want to deploy the model, you can save it and use it for future predictions
